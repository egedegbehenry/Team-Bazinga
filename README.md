  # Rock Paper Scissors Lizard SpockThis website has been based on the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game popularised by the Big Bang Theory television series. This site provides an interactive version of the game where users can play against the computer, the first player to reach 10 is the winner.The website has been made to complete the second project within the Code Institute Full Stack Developer course and focuses predominately on the use of the Java Script language. It also uses HTML5 and CSS for the structure of the site being built in a way that allows it to be responsive across a range of devices.![Am I responsive? for Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game website](/assets/readMe-images/RPSLS_responsive.png)Link to live project: https://egedegbehenry.github.io/Team-Bazinga/# User ExperienceThe target audience for this site are fans of the Big Bang Theory who will already be familiar with the game from watching the television series. This site is intended to allow them to play the game, as seen on television, against a randomised computer output.The user goals for new and returning users are the same:
- As a user, I want a simple and intuitive interface, so that I can easily understand how to play the game without any confusion.
- As a new user, I want a tutorial mode that guides me through the basics of the game, so that I can quickly learn how to play.
- As a user, I want a simplified explanation of how to play the game and move interactions, so that I can understand how each move wins or loses against others.
- As a user, I want immediate feedback after each round, so that I know whether I won, lost, or tied the round.
- As a user, I want the game to be optimized for mobile devices, so that I can play smoothly on my smartphone or tablet.# Development PlanesTo develop the site in a structured manner the 5 development planes have been considered. Working through these in a systematic manner allows the key building blocks of the site to be in place before fine tuning the aesthetics. Working methodically in this way should result in the initial release being much closer to the final desired output.
